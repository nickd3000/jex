Lanterna Library
================
Caveats
We can't detect SHIFT being pressed - no SHIFT+TAB
We can't detect CTRL or ALT as individual key presses - no ALT to open menu.

UI tweaks Phase 1
[*] center file window
[*] escape can close file panel
[*] ctrl+o to open file window
[*] reset selected row when changing directory
[*] cancel button can close file panel
[*] file dropdown should be closed after loading file
[*] up can open menu too
[*] when dropdown opens, first item should be selected
[*] dropdown selection should wrap?


TASKS
[ ] create mainframe panel type
[ ] start input routing
[ ] cascading redraw
[ ] bug - deleting at start of file has weird outcome
[ ] load file
[ ] file browser
[ ] save file
[ ] horizontal scrolling
[ ] line numbers
[ ] word caching - i.e. don't add a node for each letter
[ ] menu system
[ ] selection (shift+direction)
[ ] explore mouse options


DONE
[*] color palette system
[*] scroll bar
[*] Detect screen size change
[*] set up document and view repositories
[*] load file from command line
[*] prevent cursor moving to location with no character
[*] cursor x memory
[*] viewport scrolling
[*] page up and down
[*] load file from command line
[*] add to github
[*] create maven project
[*] get jar built with lanterna libraries included
[/] create simple wrapper around lanterna - no point?
